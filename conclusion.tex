\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we propose and then comprehensively study a flexible trespassing detection solution framework adopting state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The proposed framework can trade off processing speed and accuracy. Although initially envisioned for railroad security, the proposed approach has potential applications in video surveillance domains characterized by a sparsity in activity.  The ARTS framework features two stages where the first stage is designed to efficiently remove the background frames from the activity frames. The second stage is responsible for differentiating between human trespassing activity and any other unknown activity. Our proposed ARTS framework adapts a plug and play infrastructure to allow researchers to plug in other algorithms relevant to stage 1 or to stage 2, with ease in the future. The effectiveness of our approach has been demonstrated on a public domain surveillance dataset. 

Future direction is to build a trespassing prediction system that uses the output of this detection system to predict trespassing events. Another direction is to improve the accuracy of detection system. We note that the current accuracy is limited by the accuracy of stage 2. Currently stage 2 does not use any temporal information, i.e., each frame is treated independently and is not conditioned on the previous frames (history). The utilization of the temporal information can significantly improve the performance specially for challenging cases of occlusion and background.
