\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we propose a flexible trespassing detection system that can trade off speed and performance. Although initially envisioned for railroad security, the proposed approach has potential applications in video surveillance domains characterized by a sparsity in activity.  The system by design consists of two stages where the first stage is responsible for efficiently removing the background frames from the activity frames. The second stage is responsible for differentiating between human trespassing activity and any other unknown activity. Our proposed pipeline is composed of off-the-shelf components, allowing researchers to plug in other algorithms relevant to stage 1 and stage 2. The effectiveness of the approach has been demonstrated on a public domain surveillance dataset. 

For the future, one key direction is to build a trespassing prediction system that uses the output of this detection system to predict trespassing events in near future. Another direction is towards improving the accuracy of detection system. We note that the current performance is limited by the performance of stage 2. Currently stage 2 does not use any temporal information i.e. each frame is treated independently and is not conditioned on the previous frames (history). We believe that utilizing the temporal information can significantly improve the performance specially for challenging cases of occlusion and background.
